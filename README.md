A project to try and get back into Java coding.

This is a very simple chat app. It contains a server and a client. It will have a GUI aspect to it configured using Swing.
The project covers basic networking, basic UI, message display, etc.

So in my first stint, the other week, I got the basic app running as a commandline tool. Then I added the GUI aspects on my second visit to the project. I was able to finish it off from the blog later that same day.

All in all I think to get this to the completion of the blog it took me about half a day total. There are a few next steps I should look into taking. 

- This project does not include testing infrastructure. The blog does mention what you should test and where it sits in testing sections, but doesn't include it.
- Some investigation into how to implement this outside of localhost. There is no mention of that, but that's just a matter of infrastructure really.
- Documentation - Also mentioned at the end of the blog. They do recommend keeping a ReadMe such as this up to date, but proper engineering docs and user docs would be a nice addition.
